# *Alkhtio*: Algorithms and Competitive Programming [![Public license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20%28Expat%29-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

My personal playground  for deliberate practice in the  field of algorithms
and competitive  programming, I  am writing these  programs along  with the
reading of the following books:

1. Introduction to Algorithms (Thomas H. Cormen et al.); and

2. [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://github.com/pllk/cphb) (Antti
   Laaksonen).

My language of choice for this repository is C++, the rationale behind this
decision is  that, being a  developer proficient in  C, I always  wanted to
learn  this language  and another  reason for  this is  the C++'s  Standard
Library, mainly the `algorithm` and container headers.

This is  not meant to  be a library, the  functions presented here  are not
modular,  they  are not  thoroughly  tested,  and  they generally  are  not
concerned  with software  engineering  practices; for  the C++  programming
language  the aforementioned  Standard  Library itself  already provides  a
substantial  amount   of  algorithms,   if  it   is  not   sufficient,  the
[Boost](https://www.boost.org/) libraries contains  a rich and high-quality
set of algorithms for various purposes.
